News from the SBGN world
------------------------

HM has been talking to the GO consortium, to convince them to use the AF specification in the curation procedures.

Huaiyu's grant application to the NSG for supporting SBGN is still under review.

FS received funding for further development of SBGN-ED, and there will be money available to organise a meeting. Falk's group developed a method to generate SBGN from KEGG maps.

NLN reports that Paul Thomas was appointed as invited member to the scientific committee. Nicolas stepped down as his SBGN-supporting grant ended.

AS is in contact with russian scientists very interested in SBGN. They could be a very good test bed for the new specifications.

Specifications
--------------

NLN reports on the two documents for PD. One technical normative specification, the target user being the software developers, and one user manual, which target the end user.

SM will continue to help with the PD specification, AS becoming the editor in charge.

FS takes over the AF specification but HM will continue to help.

ER remains the responsibility of NLN.

Organisation
------------

Falk will organise a poll to decide on the next SBGN TC.

We should try to engage better all the editors in their duties. NLN is to contact the relevant people.
