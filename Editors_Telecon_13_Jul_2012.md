Specifications

NLN - will release user manual soon

NLN - all should read the specification by Stuart

NLN - should be discussed if there is the need to restructure, maybe parts can be in the user manual

NLN - we could seek assistence from others (e.g. Tobias, Astrid)

Web site
--------

AV - checked all pages, some dead / inaccessible pages, broken links

AV - will fix it, will send info to mailing list

NLN - finding icon set would be good (free icon sets available)

conclusion: AV will send information to mailing list, should be discussed on COMBINE
