SBGN 9 will be held from April 29th to May 2nd, 2013, in [Edinburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), Scotland.

The meeting will be an opportunity for the SBGN community to meet face-to-face and to discuss SBGN development. In particular we want to discuss not only the current SBGN specifications, but also the future development of SBGN. Since it will be dedicated to just SBGN and will take place over 4 days it will be arguably the most important meet we have had since the Okinawa Hackathon in 2008.

The meeting will be hosted by Prof Igor Goryanin of Edinburgh University and the local organiser is Stuart Moodie. We gratefully acknowledge funding from the BBSRC.

Travel Information
------------------

### Edinburgh

The city of Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, and the second largest city in Scotland. It is a dynamic and fascinating city with a rich history and many sights worth seeing.

The official Edinburgh tourist board website and the Edinburgh city council website both list good information about Edinburgh festivals and other events, as well as museums and galleries.

Of course, no visit to Edinburgh would be complete without a visit to Edinburgh Castle.

Getting out and about in Edinburgh is relatively easy and most places in the centre of the city are walkable. There is a very good bus service with bus timetables and route maps at each bus stop. The bus fare cost a flat rate of £1.40. A day ticket cost £3.50. All tickets can be purchased from the driver on the bus. Note that no change is given and only cash is accepted so if you are going to use the bus then think ahead and save your small change. For more information go to: [<http://lothianbuses.com>](http://lothianbuses.com).

Generally Edinburgh is a friendly place and the locals are very proud of their city and keen to show it off. So if in doubt ask a local they will invariable be only to pleased to help. You may find they speak took quickly for you to understand. If so ask them to repeat and to slow down and you should be OK.

### Travelling by air and train

Many airlines fly direct from the US or Europe to [Edinburgh Airport](http://www.edinburghairport.com), and from the airport there is a frequent bus service to the city centre. A taxi from the airport will costs just under £20 (GBP).

An alternative is to fly to [Glasgow Airport](http://www.glasgowairport.com) and take the train from Glasgow Queen Street station (in Glasgow city centre) to Edinburgh Waverley Station (in Edinburgh city centre). The journey time is 45 mins.

Ryan Air have many flights from the Continent to Prestwick airport, which is South West of Glasgow. You can travel by train direct from the airport to Edinburgh (using changing in Glasgow). The journey takes about 2 hours.

Edinburgh Airport connects to the major Western European hub airports and it can often be cheaper (and less traumatic) to travel via Schiphol (Amsterdam) or Frankfurt airports rather than Heathrow. The cheapest flights often fly via Charles de Gaul (Paris).
