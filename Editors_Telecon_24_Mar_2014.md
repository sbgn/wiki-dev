Present:

AF spec
-------

HM: resent email concerning phenotype and pertubation (as a reminder)

TC: Anatoly made a branch to the spec and removed process at the moment

HM: we need some type of process (see next item on agenda)

SM: can use an activity to describe a process

HM: GO has a distinction between process and activity, glyph is associated with GO term (and there would be need to have a different glyph for process)

SM: Different glyph or different decorator?

HM: How can we represent a biological process (that's is missing)

Overview of the LEGO effort in GO
---------------------------------

HM: background information: very similar to AF

HM: LEGO: logical extension of GO: each gene has functional process, gene has activity, activity effects process, may be part of something - need to capture these relationships

HM: explains LEGO on a graphical example, including a version in SBGN AF

HM: Tool for large scale curation of LEGO is on the way, idea: we could support this, it would provide many diagrams in SBGN AF, need: our spec needs to allow to capture what they have

SM: do we need to provide more than a process glyph?

We will continue the discussion in the mailing list (sbgn-discuss)

COMBINE 2014 and SBGN 10 planning
---------------------------------

HM: meeting rooms, hotel rooms etc reserved (SBGN-10 and additional rooms for COMBINE)

HM: SBGN meeting before, at least one day during COMBINE for SBGN

HM and FS will prepare an agenda and send it to the standard editors for input

HARMONY 2014
------------

No editor is able to go, FS will investigate if update could be presented by e.g., former editor

FUNDING
-------

How to keep SBGN alive, how to proceed without funding, where to get funding from (needs further discussion)
