<big>The third SBGN meeting is not exactly a regular workshop, but more of a "Spec-a-thon," where we are inviting a smaller subset of the community to help iron out and prepare a first draft proposed specification for the first draft SBGN.</big> It will be held March 15-17 in Heidelberg, Germany, with local help provided by Ursula Kummer, Ralph Gauges and Sven Sahle.

-   Hiroaki Kitano (SBI & Sony CSL)
-   Mike Hucka (Caltech)
-   Nicolas Le Novère (EBI)
-   Ralph Gauges (EML Research)
-   Ursula Kummer (EML Research)

Travel Information
------------------

<div class="leftindent with-border">
<span class="subhead3">Frankfurt Airport</span>

Airport Code: FRA Tel: (+49) 069 6900 Fax: (+49) 069 690 70081

[Terminal Map](http://www.airportcity-frankfurt.com/cms/default/rubrik/13/13174.roadmap.htm)

<span class="subhead3">Ground Transportation</span>

There are 4 main alternatives to get from Frankfurt Airport to Heidelberg.

1.  Lufthansa provides a shuttle service that brings you directly from Frankfurt airport to Heidelberg. The vans depart every hour and the fare is about 20 Euro. Travel time is about 75 minutes. In order to go on one of those shuttle buses you have to reserve a seat with ICS-Logistic as mentioned on their webpage: [<http://www.lufthansa-airportbus.com/strecken_heidelberg.html>](http://www.lufthansa-airportbus.com/strecken_heidelberg.html)
    **Update 2007-03-17** (MH): For the Lufthansa shuttle bus, you can actually simply show up at the bus stop 10-15 minutes before the hour and see if you can buy a ticket right then. The “bus” is a minivan and holds only 5-6 people, so getting a reservation is safer. Cost for a round-trip ticket is 36 euros or 20 euros one way. If you expect to be taking the shuttle on the return trip, it may make more sense to opt for the round-trip ticket. Make sure to save your receipt.
2.  Airport Shuttle Service TLS will arrange a chauffeur to wait for you in the arrival hall of the relevant airport terminal. Cost is 30 euros per person for the shuttle. You need to make a reservation 96 hours in advance: [<http://www.cvb-heidelberg.de/e705/e743/index_eng.html>](http://www.cvb-heidelberg.de/e705/e743/index_eng.html)
3.  Frankfurt airport has its own train station and trains leave every 30 minutes for Mannheim/Heidelberg. Note: you have to switch trains in Mannheim. Price for a train ticket is about 23 Euro and the traveling time is about 50 minutes. The Airport station is located beside Terminal 1. From Terminal 2 take the Sky Line transit (a transfer train between terminals - departs every 2-3 minutes) to T1. Further information is available at: [<http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.exe/en>](http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.exe/en)
4.  If several people arrive at the same time, they could try to share a taxi. If you negotiate, you can get a price of about 100 Euro for a taxi ride to Heidelberg. Please make sure you ask the taxi driver about the price because otherwise he might use a different pricing schema which might be a lot more expensive. This is probably worth it only if you have a group of at least 4 people. Also, travel time may vary depending on traffic but should be somewhere between that of the train and that of the shuttle bus. Taxi ranks are on the forecourt outside both terminals.
