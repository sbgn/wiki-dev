Agenda and Minutes
------------------

### SBGN spec

-   SBGN PD spec: Equivalence operator proposal <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DO4H-IUrBRM2u4T0gFVHREn3XBp3DMg5IO06s-ygMEE/edit?usp=sharing>.
-   SBGN PD spec: Adding the equivalence operator would finalize the spec? We probably need more time to work on groups?
-   Decision: complete the equivalence operator part and then publish the spec.
