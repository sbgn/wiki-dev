# SBGN-ML Roadmap
* Progress is designated using "milestones", to avoid confusion with the SBGN Levels and versions
* This roadmap is about SBGN-ML only. Various LibSBGN implementations are expected to follow closely.

## Milestone 1 (Released, Jan 2011)
* Targeting PD Level 1 Version 1.2
* Edge routing
* Not yet complete definition of fonts and shapes.
* XML Schema for validation

## Milestone 2 (Released, Dec 2011)
* Targeting all three languages: PD, ER and AF.
* Resolve issues related ports, based on feedback from library implementation(s).
* Support and test extensibility (i.e. open SBGN-ML up for third-party extensions)
* Extra layer of validation based on schematron

## Milestone 3 (Planned December 2016)
-   MIRIAM compliance (RDF annotations in extension)
-   Colors, line thickness, stylesheets (render extension)

## Milestone 4
-   linking with external models (e.g. SBML, BioPAX)
-   Update to latest version of each spec.
    -   Nested entities
    -   Finalize Submaps
-   Complete specification for any compartment shape

## Milestone 5
* Detailed specification of all glyphs, i.e. roundness of rounded rectangles.
* Delta / diff
* Layered (Stack of) maps
